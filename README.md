🔧 Tech Stack

Backend: Django

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (CodeMirror)

Compiler Execution: Python subprocess

🛠️ How It Works

Python Execution: Runs using the system’s python3 interpreter.

C++ Execution: Uses g++ to compile and execute code.

Java Execution: Uses javac to compile and java to execute code.

Time Limit Exceeded (TLE) Handling: Uses subprocess timeout to prevent infinite loops.
